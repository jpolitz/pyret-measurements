Testing maybeMethodCall against directly calling and against having fixed-arity
helpers.  The directcall example does:

if(R.isMethod(self.dict.sum)) { $ans = self.dict.sum.full_meth(self, arg); }
else { ... }

The maybeFixedArity uses maybeMethodCall1, which doesn't spread its arguments
with ... the way maybeMethodCall does.

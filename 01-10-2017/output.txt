Some explorations into the performance of getField. The program is:

    o = {noticeable_field: {y: {z: 22}}}
    builtins.raw-each-loop(lam(_):
      o.noticeable_field.y.z
    end, 0, 50000000)

Worse: 

  .inline-check takes the .dict check and the undefined check and moves them
  directly into the code instead of having them in getField, and introduces a new
  function that unwraps the result with isRef and isMethod checks. This makes
  things worse

No significant difference:

  .noundefined-check elides a useful-for-debugging but
  semantically useless check for undefined at the beginning of getField

  .noloc elides the lookup of the location in the L list, which could in theory
  be recovered from source maps

Noticeably better:

  .noGetField just uses .dict.fieldName directly instead of calling getField,
  skipping all checks.

  .value skips the isRef and isMethod checks, and just returns the
  value directly at the end of getField

  .norefcheck omits only the check for isRef, which may be directly applicable by
  introducing a new function for ! accesses

  .perilous omits all the error checking, but keeps in all the checking for isRef
  and for isMethod. This would be reasonable to provide behind the --perilous
  flag as an override of the getFieldLocInternal runtime method

  .getter initializes the object with functions that return values, and calls
  them directly instead of calling getField. This is interesting because it's an
  alternative way to handle isRef and isMethod without explicitly checking for
  them. Of course, it will make allocating objects more expensive, which this
  test doesn't investigate
